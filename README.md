#EV_VEHICLE_PREDICTION

ðŸš€ Overview:

  This project aims to predict Electric Vehicle (EV) demand using historical sales data, economic indicators, and policy factors. The goal is to assist policymakers and businesses in planning EV infrastructure and   manufacturing.
  
Key Features:

  â€¢	Data scraping/cleaning of EV sales and socio-economic datasets.
  
  â€¢	Time-series & machine learning models for demand forecasting.
  
  â€¢	Interactive visualizations (Python/Tableau).
  
ðŸ“Š Data Sources

  â€¢	EV Sales: Vahan Dashboard | SIAM Reports
  
  â€¢	Economic Data: World Bank | RBI
  
  â€¢	Charging Stations: OpenStreetMap
  
ðŸ§  Methodology
  1.	Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering.
  2.	Exploratory Analysis (EDA): Trends, correlations, geospatial mapping.
  3.	Models Used:
	
      o	Time Series: ARIMA, Prophet
    	
      o	Machine Learning: Random Forest, XGBoost
    	
      o	Deep Learning: LSTM (if applicable)
  5.	Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, RÂ² Score.
